Cube Game - OpenGL and C

This OpenGL exercise in C/C++ allows you to run multiple cubes.
It is intended that the student implement several functionalities in the following order
is indicated. Practical classes will be used to begin the implementation of the
features.
1. Using the directional keys, move the cubes to a new position (in addition to
of having the rotation already had). All cubes move in the same way.
2. Create a tray (bottom) on which the cubes move; the board
must be built with other cubes. The movement must be in line with the
tray, i.e., each movement corresponds to moving the hub to another house
(cube) of the tray.
3. The movement of the cube, between board houses, should be smooth (animated).
4. Camera / view, which allows you to navigate around the board and zoom in / out
the board.
5. Create obstacles, represented by fixed cubes.
6. Create movable obstacles, represented by cubes that move on the board. If
moving obstacles to a house occupied by a
cube is pushed.
7. Create different shapes for the objects on the board, and animate them.
